# About LifeBalance

LifeBalance is a tool for balancing one aspect in your life: Nutrition. 

In LifeBalance the user can add consumed meals to the applications diary and the application calculates the nutritional values of the daily consumed meals. 

The user can decide which nutrient values she or he wants to track, for example Iron, Calories or Protein. These values are presented in the Daily Progress card in a user-friendly manner. 

The application also carries a trend feature where specific nutrient values are analysed on a three day period and the user is presented with a verbal feedback of hers or his current situation for that value.

LifeBalance also supports Apple's Health Data and displays a graph of the user's active calories and step count from past 7 days from Apple Health.
